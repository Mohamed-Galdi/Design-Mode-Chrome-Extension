# Design Mode ON/OFF Chrome Extension

Design Mode ON/OFF is a Chrome extension that allows users to toggle the document.designMode of any webpage. This mode enables the user to edit the content of the webpage directly in the browser. The extension icon changes from black and white to color when design mode is active, and back to black and white when it is deactivated.
